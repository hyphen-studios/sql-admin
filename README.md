# sql-admin
This Administration database is a tool to be used by DBAs and developers alike to help with their maintenance tasks and processing. It's a collection of tables and stored procedures that I've written over the years to help me with my day to day tasks, weekly, and monthly tasks.

This is for Microsoft SQL Server - Not all SQL versions have been validated.
